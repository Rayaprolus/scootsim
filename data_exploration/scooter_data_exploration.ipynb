    "# Motivation\n",
    "As a resident of Los Angeles or its surrounding cities, it's hard to miss the impact the micromobility movement (e-scooters, electric bikes, etc.) has had on the landscape. As an avid user of these products, and supporter of micromobility in general, I had long been interested in studying user behavior with these vehicles. Specifically, I wanted to examine how these vehicles move throughout a particular region, and study how micromobility companies could maximize their usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Until recently, I assumed because the companies that supply these vehicles (Bird, Lime, Uber, Lyft, etc.) do not have public APIs, my study would be limited by lack of data. However, I came across a great blog post by Conor McLaughlin (http://conormclaughlin.net/2018/08/tracking-the-flow-of-bird-scooters-across-dc/), demonstrating how to obtain and interrogate Bird data for insights."

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background:** In my simplified model, company employees (often called \"Chargers\") have two types of opportunities to intervene/impact the distribution of scooters in a particular region. The first is at the beginning of the day, when the scooters' initial locations are set. The second is throughout the day, when scooters are picked up by Chargers, their batteries are charged, and they are placed at some location for use by riders.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** My model will attempt to answer the following:\n",
    "1. What is the optimal initial placement of scooters to maximize use (and thus revenue) throughout the day? Can the placement seen in the real world be improved?\n",
    "2. Can we identify optimal \"intervention points\" for a Charger to redistribute the location of a scooter?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caveats:** From the outset, there are some clear limitations my model will have:\n",
    "1. I do not have insight into Bird's cost model, meaning the cost of sending a Charger out to intervene. Therefore, I will have to make some assumptions to determine a \"breakpoint\" at which intervention becomes the more profitable option.\n",
    "2. I will be discretizing time and space, and likely coarse-grain my collected data to produce reliable results. Therefore, I will not be able to accurately capture revenue (Bird's revenue model involves a ride start fee, followed by a per minute usage charge). This means I will be using heuristics and averages to quantify revenue, which likely will not exactly align with the revenue captured per ride.\n",
    "3. As will be discussed in the Gathering Bird data section, I am limited by the Bird API in the data I can actually obtain. As the company Bird has access to much more of its own data, it is unlikely my model will be able to outperform the optimizers Bird's data science team uses. That being said, my personal goal for this project is to get hands-on experience with this data set, and hopefully achieve decent model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of procedure\n",
    "My approach will be as follows:\n",
    "1. Collect geographic data to establish an area of interest: This will be the area in which I monitor Bird distribution over time.\n",
    "2. Collect Bird data for the search area: I plan to collect data on all Birds within the given area at frequent intervals for a large enough period of time to capture significant trends.\n",
    "3. Perform exploratory data analysis and commence model development.\n",
    "4. Use collected data to make future predictions about the locations of Birds.\n",
    "5. Predict utility of a fleet of Birds for a day by using future Bird location predictions.\n",
    "6. Identify optimal intervention points/initial placements to maximize fleet utility."

    "\n",
    "Although Bird's \"nearby scooters\" API endpoint has a parameter for radius, I was unable to find much success using it. After some experimentation, I observed that no matter what value I specified for the search radius, the same set of Birds was returned (with the exception of setting radius to 0, which produced an empty result). Perhaps other users have found more success with specifying a radius; however, given my inability to use it, I constructed a method to collect the locations of all Birds within my area of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying functions are all mentioned in more detail below; however, I will give an overview of my approach here. Given a search area, I locate the contained Birds as follows:\n",
    "1. I drop a search point at the centroid of the search area, and collect all nearby Birds.\n",
    "2. The collected Birds are added to a set. As each Bird has a (latitude, longitude) point, a convex polygon can be formed around the collected Birds. We will call this the covered area.\n",
    "3. While the covered area is still contained within the search area, we continue to search.\n",
    "4. The vertices of the covered area now become the new set of search points to collect nearby Birds.\n",
    "5. If no Birds found around a particular search point are within the search area, that search point is considered a \"dead end\", and the results of its search are discarded.\n",
    "6. However, if any of the Birds found around a particular search point are within the search area, the results of its search are all added to the set of found Birds, the covered area is recomputed, and a new set of search points is formed from the vertices of the new covered area.\n",
    "7. To ensure multiple search points are recovering the same Birds, de-duplication is used to limit the results of a search to only new (i.e., not previously found) Birds.\n",
    "8. This process continues until either the covered area contains the search area or all search points become dead ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a search region is comprised of multiple search areas (as is the case with our Los Angeles example), this process is run independently on each constituent search area, and the results are de-duped to preserve uniqueness."
